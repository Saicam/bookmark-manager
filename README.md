# Bookmark manager Challenge

For the 6th week we will build a web application with a database integrated to store the bookmarks a user wants.

## Challenge 01: Creating User stories

In this challenge we will write our user stories from the specifications required:

- Show a list of bookmarks
- Add new bookmarks
- Delete bookmarks
- Update bookmarks
- Comment on bookmarks
- Tag bookmarks into categories
- Filter bookmarks by tag
- Users are restricted to manage only their own bookmarks

We will focus in the first requirement,

>As a user,
So that can remember my favourites web pages,
I'd like see a list of my bookmarks.

With this user story we will draw a rough Domain model. (taken from walkthrough)
